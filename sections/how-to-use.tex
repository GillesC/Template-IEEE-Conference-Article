\section{How To Use this template and best practices}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make use of the \textbf{glossaries} package to conveniently expand abbreviations in the correct manner. The abbreviations are located in \texttt{abbr.tex}.
    \item Use \textbf{booktabs} 
    \item Use distinct and descriptive labels to reference figures/tables/...
    \item Use \texttt{cref} opposed to just \texttt{ref}.
    \item Use plain old CSV to transform eps/png/pdf figures to \textbf{tikz} figures which gives us more control over the aesthetics of the figures (coherent coloring scheme, font size, font family, size,...)
    \item Make use of the \texttt{defineauthors} command (see \texttt{main.tex}) to use inline comments. Example: \gilles{example comment}.
\end{itemize}
